# api-demo

A short demo of what an API is to VA stakeholders. CSV data taken from:

[VA Cemetery Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/va-cemeteries-address-location-contact-information-burial-space)

put into sqlite DB. Run `burials-api` in the usual way, then `burials-map` and `burials-manager` call its endpoints.
